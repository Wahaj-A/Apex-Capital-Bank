RAG AGENT — lightweight version (no torch, no faiss, no langchain)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This replaces the previous HuggingFaceEmbeddings + FAISS setup, which
pulled in `torch` (~500MB+ just for that one dependency) — the main
reason the deployed backend was too large for free hosting tiers.

Retrieval here uses TF-IDF instead of neural embeddings — a classic,
lightweight technique (needs only scikit-learn, a few MB) that scores
text chunks by matching distinctive words. It's less "smart" than neural
embeddings at catching paraphrased meaning, but for a small terms
document with direct-ish questions, it works well and removes ~90% of
the backend's total install size.

Generation (writing the final answer) is unchanged — still uses your
existing Gemini client, same as before.

ask_bank_policy(question, history=None) keeps the existing return type and
adds optional conversation context for follow-up policy questions.
